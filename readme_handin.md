**Description for Program Running:**



**Description for Project Design:**

* This project contain the following functions:

  * processUserInput: handle inputs from the command line

  * fetch_relevant_pages: fetch pages that contain targeted information based on user feedbacks

  * compute_word_scores: compute scores for words occurred in relevant pages using keyBERT

  * fetch_new_words: use the query dictionary, which is updated by *compute_word_scores*, to get new words for the next iteration

  * reorder_new_words: reorder new search words generated by *fetch_new_words*

* The workflow of this project can be described as follow:
  * While the current precision is smaller than the target precision, we first retrieve search results using Google Search API. Only the url, title and the snippet of each page will be processed. Then, user feedback for each page is asked to decide whether the given page is relevant to the requested information. Then scores for words in relevant pages are computed to obtain a query dict, which is the reference for the choice of new search words. Then, new search words are extracted from the query dict. And finally, we reorder the newly extracted words to perform the search for the next iteration.
* External libraries used in the code
  * This project uses a key word extraction tool, keyBERT (https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT). We use this package to assign a score for every word in relevant pages for further keyword selection.

**Description of the query-modification method:**

* Adding new keywords: 
  * unfinished.
